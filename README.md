This repository serves as a centralized collection of UI Automated Tests designed for a variety of well-known and dummy websites. The primary objective of this project is to explore, demonstrate, and evaluate the capabilities of modern UI testing frameworks and tools across different environments.
Each test case has been crafted using widely adopted tools and programming languages to showcase best practices, tool-specific strengths, and cross-platform compatibility. This repository is particularly useful for:

* Gaining insights into how different testing tools operate in real-world scenarios

* Comparing testing strategies and approaches across frameworks

* Understanding automation coverage potential for dynamic and static web interfaces

ðŸ”§ The tech stack includes a mix of popular testing libraries, such as Selenium, Playwright, and others â€” implemented in languages like TypeScript, Python, and C#.

Whether you're a beginner exploring automation or an experienced QA engineer benchmarking tools, this repository aims to provide value through real-world, hands-on examples.
